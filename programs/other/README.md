Welcome to the **Others** section!  
This folder is for all programming languages not covered by the other folders.  
Got a cool Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, or Dart script? Add it here! 🚀

## 💡 What You Can Add
- “Hello World” programs in any language
- Basic syntax or data structure examples
- Short algorithms or mini utilities
- Language-specific tricks

---

## 🧩 Naming Convention
Use clear and descriptive filenames:
- hello_world.go
- factorial.rs
- reverse_string.rb

## 🧠 Example
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go!")
}
