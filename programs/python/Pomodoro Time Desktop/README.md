## 📖 About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

## ✨ Features

- **25-minute work sessions** followed by **5-minute short breaks**
- **15-minute long breaks** after every 4 work sessions
- **Visual countdown** with minutes and seconds
- **Session tracking** to monitor your productivity

### 🎨 User Interface
- **Clean, modern dark theme** for reduced eye strain
- **Color-coded sessions**: 
  - 🔴 Red for work sessions
  - 🟢 Green for break sessions
- **Real-time session information** display
- **Intuitive controls** with clear button labels

### ⚡ Smart Controls
- **Start/Pause/Resume** functionality
- **Reset** to restart current session
- **Skip** to move to next session
- **Manual session selection** (Work, Short Break, Long Break)
- **Automatic session progression** with notifications

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually comes bundled with Python)

### Steps
1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pomodoro-timer
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python pomodoro_timer.py
   ```

### Alternative: Direct Download
1. Download the `pomodoro_timer.py` file
2. Open terminal/command prompt in the download directory
3. Run: `python pomodoro_timer.py`

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Workflow
1. **Launch the application**
2. **Click "Start"** to begin a 25-minute work session
3. **Focus on your task** until the timer completes
4. **Take a 5-minute break** when notified
5. **Repeat the cycle**
6. **After 4 work sessions**, enjoy a 15-minute long break

### Controls Explained
- **Start/Pause/Resume**: Toggle the timer on and off
- **Reset**: Restart the current session from the beginning
- **Skip**: Immediately move to the next session type
- **Session Buttons**: Manually switch to Work, Short Break, or Long Break

### Session Structure
```
Work (25 min) → Short Break (5 min) → Work (25 min) → Short Break (5 min) → 
Work (25 min) → Short Break (5 min) → Work (25 min) → Long Break (15 min) → Repeat
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Built With

### Code Architecture
The application follows an object-oriented design with:
- `PomodoroTimer` class managing the main application
- Separate methods for UI setup, timer logic, and event handling
- Clean separation between business logic and presentation layer

## 🎯 Benefits of Using This Timer

- ✅ **Improves Focus**: Dedicated work intervals minimize distractions
- ✅ **Prevents Burnout**: Regular breaks maintain mental freshness
- ✅ **Enhances Productivity**: Structured workflow increases output
- ✅ **Tracks Progress**: Session counter provides motivation
- ✅ **Reduces Eye Strain**: Dark theme is easier on the eyes

## 🔧 Customization

You can easily modify the timer durations by changing these constants in the code:

```python
self.work_time = 25 * 60    # Change 25 to desired work minutes
self.short_break = 5 * 60   # Change 5 to desired short break minutes  
self.long_break = 15 * 60   # Change 15 to desired long break minutes
```
